# Final Project

MATLAB application developed for use as an input device, utilising only the user's eye postions (acquired via USB webcam).
Limited in its inability to compensate for head movement post-calibration (works best when remaining very still).

- The application can be installed via the mlappinstall file to a MATLAB IDE (developed using R2022b)
- The MATLAB source code can be found in the "Artefact Source Code" folder
- A compatible application ("Galaxy Shooter.exe") developed for testing can be found in the "Galaxy Shooter (Compatible Game)" zipped folder
- Source code used in the compatible application for connectivity with the MATLAB app can be found in "EyeGazeInputManager.cs"
